				<p>Firstly this novel best fits the definitnion of text given by the Oxford English Dictionary:
				<blockquote cite=https://www.oed.com/search/dictionary/?scope=Entries&q=text style="color:white;">
				"(A unit of) connected discourse whose function is communicative and which forms the object of analysis and description."

				<p><em>Brave New World</em> is a dystopic novel written in 1932 by critically aclaimed author Aldous Huxley. This calls to question who Hulxey was.Born in 1894 Aldous Huxley grew to be an aclaimed writer of over over 40 novels and tutor of the imphamous George Orwell to which he can be cited as an inspiration.</center>

				in order to acess my own analysis of the novel, specifiaclly on the theme of isolation that can be found throught the dystopic novel as:<br/> 
				<blockquote cite=https://fourminutebooks.com/brave-new-world-quotes/ style="color:white;">
				“But I don’t want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin.”

				<h4 class="subheadings">About the Text</h4>
				<div class="text">
				<em> Brave New World </em> is a stand along novel, still it could be contained within the works of Aldous huxley as his writings had similar themes. His works can be acessed through Huxley's publisher Harper & Brothers where the novel can be purchased in a physical or digital form. Coppies of the work are atainable through a myriad of other ways, such as: 
				</p>
				<ul style="color:white;">
					<li> Amazon </li> 
					<li>Libraries </li>  
					<li>Book stores </li>
					<li> pdfs on the internet</li>
				</ul>
				<p > However the novel is <strong>banned</strong> in numerous countries such as Ireland and many states in the US. Nevertheless, the restrictions on this text are lessening and in 50 years it may be availible for all to read in a paper or online format. Thankfully, I and many other scholars have been able to acess and study the text and its connotations.
